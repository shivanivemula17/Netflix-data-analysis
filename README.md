- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **NumPy**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## 📊 Sample Analysis  
Here are some key insights from the analysis:  

### 🔹 1. Content Trends Over the Years  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("netflix_data.csv")

# Convert date to datetime format
df['release_year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['release_year'], errors='coerce')

# Plot content distribution by year
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.histplot(df['release_year'].dropna(), bins=20, kde=True, color='red')
plt.title("Netflix Content Released Over the Years")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
